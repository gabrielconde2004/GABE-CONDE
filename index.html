<p style="color:white">My three hobbies!</p>

<p>-music</p>

<p>-dance</p>

<p>-outdoor leisure</p>

<br>

<p style="color:green">One of my hobbies is music.<br>I have an immense passion for music.<br>I play guitar, drums, clarinet, and piano.<br>I love creating and making sound that people can enjoy.<br>Music has been quite an amazing journey for me.<br>I had to overcome obstacles that challenged me.<br>I would stay up learning guitar chords and melodies.<br>Little did I know that after four years of playing I would finally be able to read and interpret music.<br>I can learn and play any song with just the look of a music sheet.</p>

<br>

<p style="color:white">Another one of my hobbies is performing cultural dance.<br>Performing these dances allow me to tap into my culture.<br>Along with it culture is something that makes me who I am.</p>

<p style="color:red">Lastly is spending time outdoors.<br>I love getting a well needed break from being inside all day.<br>I get to feel the fresh air up against my face and feel at peace. <br>Not only that, but I love to explore the beauty that Mother Nature has gifted us with.<br>From mountainsides to tropical beaches.
